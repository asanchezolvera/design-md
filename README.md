# Golden Hippo — Brand Design Systems

Comprehensive design system documentation for all Golden Hippo brands. Each brand's `DESIGN.md` is a self-contained reference covering visual identity, color, typography, components, layout, and AI agent prompt guidance.

Each brand lives in its own subdirectory under [`skills/`](skills/) and contains both a `DESIGN.md` (full spec) and a `SKILL.md` (AI-agent-loadable summary). All brands are registered in [`skills/index.json`](skills/index.json) with their slug, display name, and canonical paths. New brands should be added to the registry when their DESIGN.md is created.

## Brand Skills

Each completed brand can be paired with a `SKILL.md` — a ~100-line, AI-agent-loadable summary derived from its `DESIGN.md`. Skills give coding agents the brand's color tokens, type scale, component patterns, and guardrails in a single compact file so they can produce on-brand UI without parsing the full spec.

Generate or refresh a skill with the `generate-brand-skill` skill:

- Pass a brand slug (e.g. `bhmd`) to process a single brand.
- Pass no arguments to regenerate skills for every brand listed in `skills/index.json`.

## Document Structure

`DESIGN.md` files are written in **spec format**: YAML front matter (version, name, description, full color/typography/spacing tokens) followed by prose documentation. Every document follows the same 9-section format:

1. **Visual Theme & Atmosphere** — Brand personality, mood, and key visual characteristics
2. **Color Palette & Roles** — Primary brand colors (11-step OKLCH palettes), semantic colors (error/info/success/warning), surface neutrals, borders, and gradients
3. **Typography Rules** — Font families, size/weight/line-height/tracking hierarchy, and typographic principles
4. **Component Stylings** — Buttons, cards, inputs, navigation, image treatment, and brand-distinctive components
5. **Layout Principles** — Spacing scale, grid/container specs, whitespace philosophy, and border radius scale
6. **Depth & Elevation** — Shadow scale with brand-specific usage guidance
7. **Do's and Don'ts** — Brand-specific guardrails for visual and interaction design
8. **Responsive Behavior** — Breakpoints, touch targets, collapsing strategies, and image behavior
9. **Agent Prompt Guide** — Quick-reference color tables, example component prompts, and AI iteration guidance

## Shared Standards

The following are standardized across all brands and appear identically in each document:

- **Semantic palettes** — Error (Red), Info (Blue), Success (Green), Warning (Yellow) use Tailwind default scales
- **Focus ring** — `Blue-500` (`#3b82f6`) for all accessibility focus states
- **Spacing scale** — Full standardized scale from 0px to 1920px
- **Shadow scale** — 7-tier system from `2xs` to `2xl`
- **Breakpoints** — `sm` (640px), `md` (768px), `lg` (1024px), `xl` (1280px), `2xl` (1536px)
- **Minimum touch targets** — 44px for tappable elements

Brand-specific decisions live in the primary color palettes, font families, border-radius defaults, and whitespace philosophy.

## Conformance

Every brand `DESIGN.md` must conform to the canonical taxonomies defined in [`CONTEXT.md`](CONTEXT.md) — the shared vocabulary, meta-rules, and required component-token roles that all brands share. The `generate-brand-skill` skill enforces this contract: it runs `scripts/validate-design.mjs` against the target `DESIGN.md` before writing `SKILL.md`, and aborts with the violation list on any non-conformance, so no brand can drift back out of conformance via routine regeneration. Brand-specific patterns that fall outside the canonical taxonomy belong in the prose sections of `DESIGN.md` as prose recipes, not as new front-matter tokens.
